# 🌌 Seelam Malakonda - Creative Developer Portfolio

> **"Where AI meets Interactive Design."**

Welcome to my digital universe. I'm **Seelam Malakonda**, an aspiring AI Developer and Python enthusiast. 

This portfolio explores the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Immersive Web Design**. It goes beyond static pages, offering a 3D interactive experience where skills seek orbit in a galaxy and interfaces react with AI-driven personality.

Built with the latest **Next.js 14** stack, it serves as both a showcase of my projects and a playground for my experiments with React Three Fiber, Framer Motion, and Generative UI.



## 🚀 Experience the Galaxy

Don't just scroll—**explore**. 
- **Rotate** the Skill Galaxy to see my tech stack in 3D.
- **Toggle** interactions to see the UI morph between "Pro" and "Gamer" modes.
- **Hover** over project cards for holographic 3D tilt effects.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🪐 3D Skill Galaxy:** An interactive universe of skills built with `react-three-fiber`. Icons hover in 3D space, orbit, and focus on interaction.
- **🤖 Artificial Intelligence Theme:** A sleek, futuristic UI with "Gamer" vs "Professional" personality modes.
- **⚡ High Performance:** Built on Next.js App Router for distinct SEO advantages and lightning-fast loads.
